%This file is to be populated with the list of files that contain
% meshes relevant to the current simulation.  Each file is to be specified
% on its own line using the following rules:
% The line must begin with '>'.  Lines not beginning with '>' will be ignored.
% Immediately following the '>', specify the name by which this tissue should be referenced
% Following the tissue name, add ' : ' followed by the filename of the mesh associated
%  with the tissue
% Following the filename, add ' : ' followed by the conductivity in S/m
%  associated with the tissue
% Following the conductivity, add ' : ' followed by the tissue name of the
%  tissue enclosing the current tissue.  Note that the enclosing tissue's name
%  must match the tissue name of one other tissue in the file.  For a tissue
%  enclosed only by free space, use 'FreeSpace' as the enclosing tissue name.
%  The enclosing tissue's line need not appear before the line that references it
% Referenced files must be .mat files generated by model00_stl_to_mat.m!
