function [P, t, normals, centroids, areas, Indicator, condin, condout, contrast] = clean_coincident_facets(P, t, normals, centroids, areas, Indicator, condin, condout, contrast)
%   This function searches for facets that are duplicates of other facets, or otherwise have centroids that are
%   too close together to be properly treated by BEM-FMM.  It removes one copy of each of these duplicate facets
%   to ensure that the algorithm executes properly.
