% This function calculates n*grad(1/r) at a given observation point obsPoint
% given a triangle with vertices r1, r2, and r3 and normal vector normal.
% It uses the solid-angle approximation of Van Oosterom and Strackee 1983
% to quickly compute the normal component of the field in the vicinity of
% the triangle.
% r1: Nx3 first triangle vertex location for N triangles
% r2: Nx3 second triangle vertex location for N triangles
% r3: Nx3 third triangle vertex location for N triangles
% obsPoint: Mx3 list of observation points at which electric field should be evaluated
% Int: MxN matrix of integral contributions to each point.  Right-multiply by column
%  vector of triangle weights (e.g. charges) to obtain total contribution to each
%  observation point.
